= JrCs Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


== Installation

  env GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://github.com/JrCs/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


== Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling.
